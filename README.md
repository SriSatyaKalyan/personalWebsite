# Kalyan Kallepalli

## This is my personal website. I would add the following features soon

- [ ] Home Page
  - [ ] Add Bootstrap icons
  - [ ] In the kalyan/kallepalli text, have them alternate between avid/reader (or) aspiring/screenwriter as they flip into other text, instead of hardcoding them below that h2 text
- [ ] Photography Page
- [ ] Books Page
  - [ ] Would be a responsive grid
  - [ ] When you scroll over the book, a personal favorite quote/excerpt from the book would appear
- [ ] Articles and Quotes Page
- [ ] LeetCode Notion Notes
- [ ] Bootstrap Icons (Home, Work, Books etc.) turn into images when hovered
- [ ] Courses currently pursuing
- [ ] Career, Projects (Selenium and other stuff) and Certifications
- [ ] Wishlist

## and many more
