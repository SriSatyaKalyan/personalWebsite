# Kalyan Kallepalli

## This is my personal website. I would add the following features soon

### Features

#### Home Page

- [ ] Bootstrap Icons (Home, Work, Books etc.) turn into images when hovered
- [ ] In the kalyan/kallepalli text, have them alternate between avid/reader (or) aspiring/screenwriter as they flip into other text, instead of hardcoding them below that h2 text
- [ ] Photography Page

#### Books Page

- [ ] Would be a responsive grid
- [ ] When you hover over the book, a personal favorite quote/excerpt from the book would appear
  - Link: <https://readwise.io/api_deets>
- [ ] To add a book, have an entry page which takes in book name, link to corresponding Readwise API highlights, and book image
- [ ] Articles and Quotes Page

#### Work

- [ ] LeetCode Notion Notes
- [ ] Career, Projects (Selenium and other stuff) and Certifications
- [ ] Jenkins jobs updates (and health)
  - Link: <https://jenkinsapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using_jenkinsapi.html#>
